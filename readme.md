### Project Description
GoofLoop is a fun, interactive, web-based game platform with 100 progressively unlocked levels.  
Each level presents a quirky, ‚Äúuseless‚Äù challenge ‚Äî from clicking a moving box to holding a button for 3 seconds and etc ‚Äî rewarding with points, badges, and confetti (because why not?).Can be purchase goodies with the eraned points

### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
When there‚Äôs absolutely nothing to do, and you still want to feel like you‚Äôve accomplished‚Ä¶ something.


### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
We include simple games. Each level has a useless task to complete.‚Äù
